i programed this softwear in r using r-studio 
and librarys like Shiny and Tibble to help with the interactive ui and the api calls and their parsing.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- i could fix the bugginess and little bit of instability with the api cals and having to push the button again if it fails 
- could add a way to look at zones and potentialy how long they should be watered.
-could add the ability to look at other plants by puting in manualy the amount of water that plant needs.
